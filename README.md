#Processing Playground

Some experiments:
 * dfsmaze: maze generator and solver, using backtrack and dfs 
 * glitch: create JPEG glitches
 * PixelInvadersLogo: create an animated 3d logo, works only for processing < 2, as it uses the peasy library.
 * Vectorizer: recreate an image using triangles
 * LoadVectorizerData: Load an image out of vectors, created by Vectorizer
